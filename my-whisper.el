;;; Commentary:

;; My-Whisper provides simple speech-to-text transcription using
;; Whisper.cpp.  It records audio via sox and transcribes it using
;; Whisper models, inserting the transcribed text at your cursor.

;; Features:
;; - Two transcription modes: fast (base.en) and accurate (medium.en)
;; - Custom vocabulary support for specialized terminology
;; - Automatic vocabulary length validation
;; - Async processing with process sentinels
;; - Clean temporary file management

;; Basic usage:
;;       M-x my-whisper-transcribe  ; Use mode selected by `my-whisper-model'
;;                                  ; which is the accurate mode by default.
;;   C-u M-x my-whisper-transcribe  ; Fast mode (base.en model)

;; Recommended keybindings (add to your init.el):
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c n") #'my-whisper-transcribe)

;; See the README for installation and configuration details.
